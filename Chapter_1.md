#Lesson 1: Concepts of RDBMS and MongoDB

### 1. Which of the following are some of the main features of MongoDB? (Select all that apply.)

~~A. The MongoDB query language is optimized to pull data from many collections at once.~~
```
Pulling data from many collections, like Relational Databases Management Systems do, is inefficient.
MongoDB uses the power of the Document Model to keep information that needs to be retrieved together in the same location.
```

B. Scalability allows to seamlessly scale across multiple servers to store and process data.Your Answer 
```
As data volumes and performance requirements grow, you can add more servers instead of upgrading to million-dollar mainframes.
This feature is also great for cloud environments where spreading load across lots of machines is by far the best way to scale.
```

C. Fault tolerance is natively built into MongoDB by keeping redundant copies of the same data on different servers.Your Answer 
```
This feature allows the application to stay functional in the event of server or network failures.
It also allows for planning maintenance on any server in the cluster without incurring downtime of the applications.
MongoDB's replication and election processes make the task of maintaining a functional cluster completely automatic.
```

D. MongoDB lets you move data where you need it, so you can keep data near users.Your Answer 
```
MongoDB lets you move data to where you need it, so you keep data near users around the globe for fast access.
For example, you can keep data for European users in Europe and keep data for the Asian users on servers in Asia.
Creating and deploying such Global Cluster in Atlas can be done quickly in a matter of a few minutes.
```
